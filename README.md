Thought for 4 seconds
I'll create a comprehensive README.md file for your frontend team:


Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn
Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Development Guidelines
Authentication
The application currently uses mock authentication:

Any valid email format and password will work
User session is not persisted between page refreshes
To test, use any email (e.g., test@example.com) and password
File Upload
The file upload component accepts CSV files for customer data
CSV or JSON files for customer interactions (AI training)
Files are not processed in this frontend implementation
Adding New Pages
Create a new directory in app/dashboard/ for your page
Add a page.tsx file with the page content
Update navigation in components/dashboard-nav.tsx if needed
Styling
We use Tailwind CSS for styling
Follow the existing color scheme and design patterns
Use the shadcn/ui components for consistency
The application supports both light and dark modes
Available Scripts
npm run dev - Start the development server
npm run build - Build the application for production
npm run start - Start the production server
npm run lint - Run ESLint to check code quality
